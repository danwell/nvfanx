nvfanx
Manages nVidia GPU Fan Power based on GPU temperatures
By David Newell

This Python script is designed to manage fan speeds on a *nix system with the
nVidia GPU driver installed. Currently, the nVidia controller maintains fan
speed only at around 30%. This script manually controls the fans using
nvidia-settings to adjust the fan speed on a sliding scale from 30% to 90% and
100% if the temperature exceeds 90'c. The script currently has support for only
one GPU.

There is one important limitation. The nVidia GPUs cannot be controlled unless
there is an active X session. This script will attempt to reactive and manage
fan control on display :0 and will continue running even if this X session
restarts (on systems with graphical login managers, for example).

This script uses the subprocess module and therefore requires Python 3 to run.

A systemd service is included, allowing systemd users to automatically start
the script on a graphical boot. "--quiet" is passed as an option by default to
suppress temperature and fanspeed readouts, which lessens the amount of
messages dumped to the system logs.

nouveau users should use nvclock instead, which does not depend on an X
session.

To install the script with a systemd service:
	$ make systemd-install
	
To uninstall the systemd service and the script:
	$ make systemd-uninstall
